# Learning More from Labels: Regularizing Deep Networks with Label Geometry for Accurate Object Localization

## Installation

Our code is based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). Please install mmdetection first, and then put our code and [KITTI images](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) in corresponding folders.

## Training

To train the model in the paper, run this command:

```train
python tools/train.py configs/kitti/fcos_center-normbbox-centeronreg-giou_r50_caffe_fpn_gn-head_dcn_1x-LGDet.py
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model on KITTI val, run:

```eval
python tools/test.py configs/kitti/fcos_center-normbbox-centeronreg-giou_r50_caffe_fpn_gn-head_dcn_1x-LGDet.py work_dirs/kitti/<path_to_trained_model> --eval bbox
```

## Pre-trained Models

We use ResNet-50 pretrained on Imagenet to train our models, which can be downloaded by default when running the training command. For a better performance, we can also pretrain distance transforms with pretrain_mask set to True. You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
